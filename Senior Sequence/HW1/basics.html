            <h2>What You Will Need</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <ol>
                <li>A pan</li>
                    <p>
                        Seriously just a pan. If all you have is one, like I did, or if it's scratched up on the 
                        bottom...
                        I mean it's not recommended but we all need to eat so get what you can. Also for the longest time
                        I was just building recipes from the bottom up in one large pan because I just didn't own much else
                        and I didn't want a lot of cleanup. Results are better when you cook your base in dish and your
                        sauce in another but don't let this be a barrier. 
                    </p>
                <li>Measuring cups</li>
                    <p>
                        Look there's no way around this and you can by a crappy set at dollar tree so just get em. (Bonus: They can double as tiny bowls or giant spoons)
                    </p>

                <li>Some sort of stirring device</li>
                    <p>
                        Spoon, spatula, etc. Don't use a fork or a knife (done it) because it's ineffective and damaging
                        to the pan. Respect the pan.
                    </p>
                <li>A flat surface for chopping</li>
                    <p>Often I'm using a plate because I'm lazy but a cutting board is recommended</p>

                <li>A knife</li>
                    <p>Use a sharp one and I would NOT recommend the serated steak knifes from dollar tree... but I have been known to use those.</p>

                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
                    <p>You'll notice I didn't include any instructions for how much seasoning to put in your sauces. It's still a good idea to use but I don't know your life so you put as much or as little as you want.</p>
            </ol>

                <p>Feel free to improvise but I tend to combine any of these whatever sauce I'm making
