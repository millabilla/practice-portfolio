                    Welcome to my recipe page Bone Apple Tea, a website for people who have a vague notion
                    of how to cook but maybe just aren't sure where to start. I have carefully curated three sauces
                    since I began going to school many moons ago. All you have to do is follow my instructions 
                    to the best of your ability and you're cooking with *fire. It is important to note that I 
                    do not actually measure any of my ingredients and I'm just going off of muscle memory.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have used these sauces on everything from pasta to zoodles to meat and pan fried vegetables.
                    In some cases, like the marinara sauce, I have just eaten it by itself like a spicy chunky tomato soup.
                    Click on "Getting Started" to see what main items you will absolutely need as
                    well as some main staples I always have on hand for each sauce. Then feel free to wander
                    on over to the "Sauces" section to begin cooking. 
                </p>

            there should be no fire. Please be aware of your surroundings.
