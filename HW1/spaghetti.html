    <h2>Chunky Marinara Sauce</h2>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>However many garlic cloves your heart desires</li>
            <li>Some kind of hot sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Process</p>
    
    <p>
        What I like to do is heat up some olive oil in a pan on a medium low setting. Measure if you're feeling calorie 
        conscious but honestly however much shampoo you use, just cut that in half. You can use 
        whatever kind of pan you like or just stick with that one pan you have that has the least 
        scratched up bottom. Throw your chopped onion and garlic in a pan and sautee it (that means
        poke at it and move it around a bit with some sort of utensil). Not too much though but just
        once in a while. The onion will become shiny and slightly translucent and that's when the time
        is right. Grab your can of tomatoes and dump it in there. Add your oregeno, bay leaf, and hot sauce. 
        Put a lid on your pan if you have one. It works better with a cover but honestly I didn't have one until 
        recently and it's chill. Just let it simmer for about 45 minutes.
