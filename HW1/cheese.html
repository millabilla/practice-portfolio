        <h2>Cheese Sauce</h2>
            <p>Ingredients</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups shredded cheese</li>
                    <li>1.5 cups milk or maybe a smaller amount of heavy cream</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons of flour OR 1 tablespoon of corn starch</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
                </ul>


            <p>Process</p>

            <p> 
                Grab a smaller pot and warm the butter over medium heat. Once it's melted add your flour or cornstarch and
                then start whisking like your life depends on it. You should be looking at what looks like
                inedible clumps of half melted glue. Good. Now would probably be a good time to season that.
                And then quick before you burn it, begin adding the milk S-L-O-W-L-Y in small
                increments and whisk as you go. You want the mixture to thicken back up each time you add 
                milk and whisk. Keep going until you're out of milk but honestly this part always feels like it takes forever. 
                It's normal. Once you have a nice thick sauce, you're goint to start adding the shredded cheese, clump by 
                clump. Wait for it to melt and mix in completely before adding more. Once all the cheese is 
                melted use it immediately or feel free to let it harden and eat it like pudding.
